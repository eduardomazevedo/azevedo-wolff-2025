This paper shows that when an agent's reservation utility is sufficiently high, the longstanding concerns about the validity of the first-order approach largely disappear. Despite the possibility of multiple local maxima under low reservation utility, forcing the principal to provide higher overall utility eliminates global deviations, ensuring both existence of an optimal contract and applicability of the standard calculus-based approach.
