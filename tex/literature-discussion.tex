\medskip\noindent\textit{\textbf{First Order Approach Literature.}}
There are three generations of contributions to the first-order approach. The first generation was started by \textcite{mirrlees1999}  (circulated in 1975), who showed that the first-order approach does not hold generally. Prior to \textcite{mirrlees1999}, the first-order approach was simply assumed with little justification. Subsequent papers became aware that they had to assume validity of the first-order approach \parencite{holmstrom1978incentives}, and developed results that do not depend on the first-order approach \parencite{grossman1983,araujo2001general}.

The seminal papers in the second generation are \textcite{rogerson1985} and \textcite{jewitt1988justifying}. They provided sufficient conditions for the first-order approach. Rogerson's conditions are well known to be strict, ruling out many natural distributions, including the Gaussian. Jewitt's conditions are more general, and include many interesting cases. Jewitt's main assumption is implicit, in that he requires his conditions to hold for all output levels, in particular ruling out limited liability. \textcite{chaigneau2022should} give a detailed explanation of how the Jewitt conditions are not applicable in the case of limited liability and survey the related literature. But limited liability is crucial to guarantee existence (see Section \ref{sec:counter-examples}). In many examples that satisfy the Jewitt conditions, an optimal contract does not exist. This includes the Gaussian - log utility example without limited liability. At face, value, the Jewitt conditions are satisfied. But the relaxed cost minimization problem does not have a solution. Thus, the firt-order approach is ``valid'', since any of the non-existent solutions satisfies any property. But this validity is vacuous. This is similar to the colorful logical example that ``all unicorns are blue''. The second-generation papers have been influential, and much of the theoretical and applied work to this day assumes these conditions.

Our own results are inspired by \textcite{jewitt1988justifying}, and we build on his insight. We impose similar conditions on the part of the contract where limited liability does not bind, while allowing for limited liability. The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main} shows that, with high reservation utility, the limited liability constraint binds with low probability. We then show, in similar lines to \textcite{jewitt1988justifying}, that the agent's problem becomes concave.

There is a third generation of work extending Jewitt's approach to multidimensional actions and richer information structures \parencite{conlon2009two,jung2015information,chade2020no,chaigneau2022should,jung2024proxy}. We believe our methods can be adapted to such environments, but we do not pursue that here.

At first glance, our Theorem \ref{thm:main} appears to contradict the standard view in the literature that the first order approach requires stringent conditions. In fact, the two are perfectly consistent. The reason is that the literature has looked for conditions under which the first-order approach is valid \emph{for every reservation utility}. Our examples show that indeed any such condition must rule out basic examples like the Gaussian-log utility example from Figure \ref{fig:gaussian-log-pp} -- an in fact all the numerical examples in this paper. Our contribution is to show that \emph{if the reservation utility is sufficiently high}, the first order approach is valid.


\medskip\noindent\textit{\textbf{Linear Contracts and Option Contracts.}}
A long literature seeks conditions under which optimal contracts are simple, such as linear contracts. The classic paper is \textcite{holmstrom1987aggregation}, who rationalize linear contracts with CARA utility in a continuous time dynamic model with Brownian output process. \textcite{innes1990limited} rationalizes piecewise linear contracts with a risk neutral agent, limited liability, and a monotonicity restriction on the wage function. Notable contributions include \textcite{chassang2013calibrated} and \textcite{carroll2015robustness} who rationalize linear contracts with risk neutral agents and a robust maxmin notion of optimality.

In contrast, we derive piecewise linear contracts under log utility and linear score. Our contracts are option contracts, with payoff of zero for low outcomes and linear increasing payment past a strike price. In some examples, our optimal contracts are linear in most of the support of the distribution of output. In some examples with a finite lower bound on the support, our optimal contracts are linear in the entire support.

The most closely related work is the contemporaneous paper \textcite{opp2025moral}. He independently derived the linearity result from remark \ref{rem:linear-contracts}. As far as we know, \textcite{opp2025moral} is the first to derive piecewise linear contracts under a broad set of conditions in standard moral hazard with risk aversion. \textcite{opp2025moral} includes a complete analysis of the exponential distribution case. He characterizes optimal contracts with and without limited liability and when the optimal exists without limited liability. We have no overlap with these results.

\textcite{hemmer1999introducing} assumes a number of Jewitt's conditions, and log utility with no limited liability. Their corollary 2 part 2 then shows that the optimal contract is globally linear. It is important to highlight the difference. They prove that contracts are globally linear, whereas we prove that contracts are piecewise linear. While their result is stronger, optimal contracts often do not exist in their setting (section \ref{sec:counter-examples}). Thus, \textcite{opp2025moral} and our paper are the first to derive piecewise linear contracts under a broad set of conditions, but \textcite{hemmer1999introducing} were the first to notice linearity of $k \circ g$ to the best of our knowledge. \textcite{chaigneau2015changes,chaigneau2017prudence} also attribute this observation to \textcite{hemmer1999introducing}.

Another closely related paper is \textcite{chaigneau2022should}. They consider the Gaussian-log utility case with limited liability, and assume validity of the first-order approach. Their lemma 2 shows that option contracts are optimal, as in our remark \ref{rem:linear-contracts}. This is the first result we know justifying option contracts in the sense of zero payment for low outcomes and linear increasing payment past a strike price. \citeauthor{holmstrom1978incentives}'s (\citeyear{holmstrom1978incentives}) thesis considers the case of log utility with an upper and lower bound on the wage function. He assumes the first-order approach and shows that the optimal contract is linear within those bounds.


\medskip\noindent\textit{\textbf{Solution of the Relaxed Cost Minimization Problem.}}
The solution to the relaxed cost minimization problem in proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract} is a trivial variation of the standard solution using the first-order approach. The case of limited liability is considered in \citeauthor{holmstrom1978incentives} (\citeyear{holmstrom1978incentives}, \citeyear{holmstrom1979moral}). \textcite{jewitt2008moral} consider an even more general case, with lower and upper bounds that depend on payments. Their elegant definition 1 is basically the definition of a canonical contract, and their proposition 1 basically the same as proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract}. We provide a proof of proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract} because our assumptions are different. \textcite{jewitt2008moral} assume the support of $y$ is a compact interval, the convexity of the distribution function condition, and bounded score. They argue that the bounded score is important for existence (p. 62), although in our setting solutions exist even with unbounded score. \textcite{moroni2014existence} corrects a mistake in \textcite{jewitt2008moral} showing the need of an assumption similar to utility being bounded below, which we make. Our existence proofs are different. \textcite{jewitt2008moral} prove that given a multiplier $\mu$ there exists a single multiplier $\lambda$ as a function of $\mu$ where the canonical contract satisfies the individual rationality constraint. They then use the intermediate value theorem to show that there exists a $\mu$ where the canonical contract satisfies all constraints. We instead prove (1) that the Lagrangian has a unique minimum that is a canonical contract (Lemma \ref{lem:lagrangian}), (2) that the Pareto problem has a solution that minimizes the Lagrangian (Lemma \ref{lem:pareto-problem}), and (3) that the Pareto problem solution solves the relaxed cost minimization problem (proof of Proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract}, Part 2). While we include the proof of proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract} for completeness, advanced readers may take it as trivial given the \citeauthor{holmstrom1978incentives} (\citeyear{holmstrom1978incentives}, \citeyear{holmstrom1979moral}), \textcite{jewitt2008moral}, and \textcite{moroni2014existence} results.
