\subsection{Closed Form Solutions}
\label{sec:calculus}
Theorem \ref{thm:main} implies that optimal contracts have simple functional forms in parametric settings. Here, we describe the solutions for common parameterizations and note their properties.

Canonical contracts depend on the utility function and limited liability constraint (through the link function) and on the distribution of output (through the score). Tables \ref{tab:utility_functions} and \ref{tab:dists} provide these formulae with common parameterizations.
