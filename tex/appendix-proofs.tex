\subsection{Solution of the Relaxed Problem} 

Throughout this subsection, fix a reservation utility $\bar U$ and regular intended action $a_0$. The local IC constraint is only defined if $U(v, a)$ can be differentiated under the integral sign, so we begin by showing that differentiation under the integral at any action is possible for any feasible contract.

\begin{remark} 
    \label{rem:leibniz}
    Let $v$ be a feasible contract. Then, for all $a$ in $\mathbb{R}_{+}$, the first and second derivatives of $U(v,a)$ with respect to $a$ exist, are finite, and are given by
    \[
        U_{a}(v,a) = \int v(y) f_{a}(y|a)\,dy\text{,}
    \]
    \[
        U_{aa}(v,a) = \int v(y) f_{aa}(y|a)\,dy\text{.}
    \]
\end{remark} 

\begin{proof}
    The conditions for Leibniz's rule to hold are in Assumption \ref{assump:leibniz}.2.    
\end{proof} 

 We now derive some intermediate results to establish proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract}. Recall the definition of the Lagrangian from equation (\ref{eq:lagrangian}) and definition \ref{def:canonical-contract} of a canonical contract.

Note that canonical contracts uniquely minimize the Lagrangian:
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:lagrangian}
    Given $\lambda$ and $\mu$ in $\mathbb R$, there exists $v$ that minimizes the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(v, \lambda, \mu)$ among all feasible contracts. $v$ is $f(\cdot | a_0)$ almost everywhere equal to the canonical contract $V(y, \lambda, \mu)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The Lagrangian in equation (\ref{eq:lagrangian}) can be written as
\[
    \mathcal{L}(v, \lambda, \mu)
    =
    \int [k(v(y)) - \lambda v(y) - \mu v(y)S(y|a_0)]f(y|a_0)\, dy + \bar U
    \text{.}
\]

Differentiating the integrand with respect to $v(y)$ yields
\[
[k'(v(y)) - \lambda - \mu S(y|a_0)]f(y|a_0)
\]

and this is strictly convex in $v(y)$. Therefore, the integrand is minimized pointwise in $v(y)$ at $v(y) = V(y | \lambda, \mu)$. Hence, the infimum is attained, and any minimizer satisfies the desired formula $f(y | a_0)$ almost everywhere.

It only remains to show that $V(y | \lambda, \mu)$ is feasible. This follows from assumption \ref{assump:leibniz} Part 4.
\end{proof}

We now note that, given $\lambda$ there is a unique value of $\mu$ that solves the local IC constraint.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:mu-tilde}
    Given $\lambda$ in $\mathbb R$, there exists a unique $\tilde \mu(\lambda)$ such that the canonical contract $V(y|\lambda, \tilde \mu(\lambda))$ satisfies the local IC constraint (\ref{LIC_relaxed}). Moreover, $\tilde \mu(\lambda) > 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have
\[
U_{a}(v)=\int v(y)f_{a}(y|a_{0})\,dy\text{.}
\]
If $\mu=0$, then $v(y)$ is constant, so
\[
    U_{a}(V(\cdot|\lambda,0,a_{0}))-c'(a_{0})<0\text{.}
\]

As $\mu\rightarrow\infty$, $V(y|\lambda,\mu,a_{0})$ converges pointwise to $u(\infty)$ if $S(y|a_0) > 0$ and to $u(0)$ if $S(y|a_0) < 0)$. Hence, because $a_0$ is regular, for large enough $\mu$,
\[
    U_{a}(V(\cdot|\lambda,\mu,a_{0}))-c'(a_{0})>0\text{.}
\]

Therefore, there exists at least one $\mu_{1}>0$ such that
\[
    U_{a}(V(\cdot|\lambda,\mu_{1},a_{0}))-c'(a_{0})=0\text{.}
\]

It only remains to prove that this solution $\mu_{1}$ is unique. To see this, note
that
\[
    U_{a}(V(\cdot|\lambda,\mu_{1},a_{0}))
\]
is weakly increasing in $\mu$. And, moreover, it is strictly increasing
at any solution $\mu_{1}$ because $c'(a_0) > 0$ implies that there is a positive measure of $y$ such that
$f_{a}(y|a_{0})>0$ and
\[
\lambda+\mu_{1}\frac{f_{a}(y|a_{0})}{f(y|a_{0})}>\frac{1}{u'(0)}\text{.}
    \]
\end{proof}

The lemma implies that the family of canonical contracts that satisfy (\ref{LIC_relaxed}) is a one-dimensional family indexed by $\lambda$. Define
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:tildeV-definition}
    \tilde V (y | \lambda) := V(y | \lambda, \tilde \mu(\lambda))
\end{equation}

Define the \textbf{relaxed Pareto problem} as finding $v$ in $\mathcal C$ to
\begin{align}
    \text{minimize} \quad & W(v) - \lambda U(v) \nonumber \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & \partial _a U(v, a_0) = 0 \tag{LIC}
\end{align}

The next lemma shows that the contracts $\tilde V (y|\lambda)$ span the solutions to the Pareto problem:

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:pareto-problem}
    Given $\lambda$ in $\mathbb R$, the relaxed Pareto problem has a solution, and any solution is $f(y|a_0)$ almost everywhere equal to $\tilde V (y | \lambda)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For any $v$ satisfying (\ref{LIC_relaxed}),
\[
W(v) - \lambda U(v)
=
\mathcal{L}(v, \lambda, \tilde \mu(\lambda)) - \lambda \bar U
\text{.}
\]

Lemma \ref{lem:lagrangian} then implies that $W(v) - \lambda(v)$ is minimized over $\mathcal C$ by $\tilde V (y | \lambda)$, and that this solution is almost-everywhere unique. This contract satisfies (\ref{LIC_relaxed}) by the definition of $\tilde \mu(\lambda)$.
\end{proof}

Define the expected wage and utility attained by these contracts as
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\tilde U (\lambda) & := & U(\tilde V(\cdot | \lambda), a_0) \text{,} \\
\tilde W (\lambda) & := & W(\tilde V(\cdot | \lambda), a_0) \text{.}
\end{array}
\]

\begin{lemma}
    \label{u-tilde-increasing}
    $\tilde U (\lambda)$ is strictly increasing.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider $\lambda _1 < \lambda _2$ with optima $v_1 := \tilde V (\cdot | \lambda_1)$ and $v_2 := \tilde V (\cdot | \lambda_2)$. By optimality,
\[
W(v_1) - \lambda_1 U(v_1) \leq W(v_2) - \lambda_1 U(v_2)
\text{,}
\]
and
\[
W(v_2) - \lambda_2 U(v_2) \leq W(v_1) - \lambda_2 U(v_1)
\text{.}
\]

Adding the inequalities,
\[
(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1) \cdot \left(\tilde U (\lambda _2) - \tilde U (\lambda _ 1) \right) \geq 0
\text{.}
\]

Therefore, $\tilde U$ is non-decreasing. It only remains to show that $\tilde U$ is strictly increasing. To reach a contradiction, assume that $\tilde U(\lambda _ 2) = \tilde U (\lambda _ 1)$. Optimality implies that $\tilde W (\lambda _1) = \tilde W (\lambda _2)$.  Let $\bar \lambda = (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2) / 2$. We have $\tilde U (\bar \lambda) = \tilde U(\lambda _ 1)$. By our assumptions on the score, $v_1$ and $v_2$ differ in a set of positive measure. By strict convexity of $k$, it follows that $\tilde W (\bar \lambda) < \tilde W (\lambda _ 1)$. This contradicts the optimality of $v_1$.
\end{proof}

The proof of proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract} follows from collecting these results.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract}]
Let $\bar U _ L : = \tilde U (0)$ and $\bar U _ R := \lim _ {\lambda \rightarrow \infty} \tilde U (\lambda)$.

\textbf{Part 1.}

The definition of $\bar U _ R$ implies that the relaxed problem is not feasible for $\bar{U} \geq \bar{U}_R$, as desired.

\textbf{Part 2.}

Let $\lambda ^*(\bar U)$ be $0$ if $\bar U \leq \bar U _L$ and be the inverse of $\tilde U$ for $\bar U _L < \bar U < \bar U _R$. Lemma \ref{u-tilde-increasing} implies that $\lambda^*$ is well defined and that $\lambda^*(\bar U) \geq 0$.

Let $\mu ^* (\bar U) := \tilde \mu (\lambda ^* (\bar U))$. Lemma \ref{lem:mu-tilde} implies that $\mu^*(\bar U) > 0$. Let $v^*(y | \bar U) := \tilde V (y | \lambda ^* (\bar U))$. Note that this coincides with the definition of $v^*$ in the proposition statement.

Lemma \ref{lem:pareto-problem} implies that $v^*(y | \bar U)$ solves the Pareto problem given $\lambda^*(\bar U)$. This implies that $v^*(y | \bar U)$ also solves the relaxed cost minimization problem given $\bar U$. Likewise, \ref{lem:pareto-problem} implies that the solution is unique almost everywhere.

\textbf{Part 3, nonbinding individual rationality case.}

This follows from the definition of $\lambda^*(\bar U)$ which equals $0$ in this range.

\textbf{Part 3, binding individual rationality case.}
$\lambda ^*$ strictly increasing follows from lemma $\ref{u-tilde-increasing}$ and the strict convexity of $\omega$ follows from $v^*(\cdot | \lambda)$ being different for each value of $\lambda$ and from $k$ being strictly convex.
    
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:concave}}
\label{subsec:proof-derivs}  

This section demonstrates that the second derivative of agent's utility is negative for sufficiently high reservation utility. The bulk of the section is spent demonstrating the same result for $\lambda$ sufficiently high, and the main result follows as an immediate corollary. Throughout this section, we use the $\tilde V (y | \lambda)$ notation defined in equation (\ref{eq:tildeV-definition}) because we are focused on the agent's problem as $\lambda$ becomes large. Although $\tilde \mu(\lambda)$ is a function of $\lambda$ (Lemma \ref{lem:mu-tilde}) we abuse notation by omitting dependence on $\lambda$ and writing $\tilde{\mu}$ to denote $\tilde{\mu}(\lambda)$. 

\begin{definition}
    Let
    \[
        \Delta g (y | \lambda) :=
        \tilde V(y| \lambda) - g(\lambda) =
        g(\lambda + \tilde{\mu} S(y|a_0)) - g(\lambda)
        \text{.}
    \]
\end{definition}



\begin{remark}
\label{lem:second-derivative}
Given a canonical contract, \( v(y) := \tilde V (y | \lambda) \), the agent's utility and its derivatives evaluated at \( a \) are:
\begin{align*}
    U(v, a)
    &= g(\lambda) + \int \Delta g(y | \lambda) f(y | a) \, dy - c(a), \\
    U_a(v, a)
    &= \int \Delta g(y | \lambda) f_a(y | a) \, dy - c'(a), \\
    U_{aa}(v, a)
    &= \int \Delta g(y | \lambda) f_{aa}(y | a) \, dy - c''(a).
\end{align*}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:threshold-output}
    The \textbf{threshold output}, $\ubar{y}(\lambda)$, is the lowest output where the agent receives positive payment. Formally,
    \[
        \ubar y (\lambda)
        :=
        \inf
        \left\{ y \in \operatorname{support}(f) :
        \tilde V(y | \lambda) > u(0)
        \right\} \text{.}
    \]
\end{definition} 

Note that $\ubar y$ is always well-defined and finite. If the support is unbounded below, then our assumptions imply that there is always a finite threshold output. If the support is bounded below, there are two cases. In the case where the agent is sometimes paid zero, the threshold output is interior. In the case where the agent is never paid zero, the threshold output is the infimum of the support. Note that there are no cases where the agent is always paid zero, as this would violate the local IC constraint.
    
\begin{lemma} 
    \label{lem:threshold-outcome}
    Assume that $g(\infty) = \infty$. As $\lambda$ approaches infinity, the threshold output approaches the infimum of the support of $f$:
    \[
        \lim_{\lambda \to \infty} \ubar y (\lambda) = \inf \operatorname{support}(f)\text{.}
    \] 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    The local IC constraint is
    \[
        c'(a_0) = \int \Delta g(y | \lambda) f_a(y | a_0) \, dy
        \text{.}
    \]
    $\Delta g(y | \lambda)$ has the same sign as $f_a(y | a_0)$. Therefore,
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        c'(a_0)
        &\geq&
        \int_{y \leq \ubar y(\lambda)} \Delta g(y | \lambda) f_a(y | a_0) \, dy \\
        &=&
        \int_{y \leq \ubar y(\lambda)} [u(0) - g(\lambda)] f_a(y | a_0) \, dy \\
        &=&
        [u(0) - g(\lambda)] \cdot F _ a (\ubar y(\lambda) | a_0) \text{.}
    \end{eqnarray*}

TODO: details, and may add result about CDF to lemma if needed below.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:inf_lambda_second_deriv}
    As $\lambda$ approaches infinity, the limit of the supremum of the second derivative of agent's utility at any action $a > 0$  is strictly negative: 
    $$
    \limsup_{\lambda \to \infty}
    \,
    U_{aa}\left( \tilde{V}\left( y |  \lambda \right), a \right) < 0\text{.}
    $$
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lem:second-derivative}, 
    $$ U_{aa}\left( \tilde{V} \left( y |  \lambda \right), a \right) = g(\lambda) + \tilde{\mu} \int \Delta g(y | \lambda) \cdot S(y|a_0) f(y | a) \, dy - c(a) $$ 
    Lemma \ref{lem:y_0} states that there exists a $y_0$ such that the integrand is negative for all $y < y_0$. It follows that 
    $$
    U_{aa}\left( \tilde{V} \left( y |  \lambda \right), a \right) \leq
    \tilde{\mu} \int_{y_0}^{\infty} 
    \Delta g(y | \lambda)
    \left( S^2(y|a) + S_a(y|a) \right) \cdot S(y|a_0)
    \cdot f(y | \hat a) \, dy - c''(a) \text{.}
    $$ 
    Let $Y_+$ be the set of $y \geq y_0$ where this integrand is positive. Then 
    $$
    U_{aa}\left( \tilde{V} \left( y |  \lambda \right), a \right) \leq
    \tilde{\mu} \int_{Y_+}
    \Delta g(y | \lambda)
    \left( S^2(y|a) + S_a(y|a) \right) \cdot S(y|a_0)
    \cdot f(y | \hat a) \, dy - c''(a) \text{.}
    $$
     Lemma \ref{lem:threshold-outcome} implies that for $\lambda$ sufficiently large, $\ubar y (\lambda, a_0) \leq y_0$. Recall that for $y>\ubar y$, $g(y) = k'^{-1}(\lambda + \mu S(y|a_0))$. The concavity of $k'^{-1}$ (Assumption \ref{assump:concavity_inverse_marginal_utility}) implies that $\Delta g$ is decreasing for $y$ in $Y_+$. Therefore,
    $$
    U_{aa}\left( \tilde{V} \left( y |  \lambda \right), a \right) \leq
    \tilde{\mu} 
    \Delta g(y_0 | \lambda)
    \int_{Y_+}
    \left( S^2(y|a) + S_a(y |a) \right) \cdot S(y_0|a_0)
    \cdot f(y | \hat a) \, dy - c''(a) \text{.}
    $$
    Because $g(y)$ is concave for $y > \ubar y$ and $y_0 > \ubar y$
    \begin{align*}
    \tilde{\mu} \Delta g(y_0 | \lambda)
    &\leq \tilde{\mu} g'(\lambda + \tilde{\mu} S(y|a_0)) \\
    &= \frac{\tilde{\mu}}{\lambda + \tilde{\mu} S(y|a_0)} \cdot (\lambda + \tilde{\mu} S(y|a_0)) g'(\lambda + \tilde{\mu} S(y|a_0)). 
    \end{align*}
    Lemma \ref{lem:mu_lambda} states that $\frac{\tilde{\mu}}{\lambda} \rightarrow 0$ as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty $, and Assumption \ref{assump:concavity_inverse_marginal_utility} implies that $(\lambda + \tilde{\mu} S(y_0|a_0)) g'(\lambda + \tilde{\mu} S(y_0|a_0))$ has a finite limit. It follows that 
    $$ U_{aa}\left( \tilde{V} \left( y |  \lambda \right), a \right) \leq - c''(a) < 0 $$ 
    with the last inequality implied by the strict convexity of the cost function (Assumption \ref{assump:utility_cost}). 
\end{proof} 

\noindent We now prove Proposition \ref{prop:concave}. 
\begin{proof}
    We first prove that there exists $\lambda_0$ such that, for all $\lambda \geq \lambda _0$ and $a$ in $\mathcal A$,
    \[
        U_{aa}(\tilde V(y | \lambda), a) \leq 0\text{.}
    \]
    
    To reach a contradiction, assume that this is not the case. Then there exists a sequence of $\lambda_n \rightarrow \infty$ and $a_k$ such that
    \[
        U_{aa}(\tilde V(y | \lambda_n), _n) > 0\text{.}
    \]
    
    Because $\mathcal A$ is compact, we can take a convergent subsequence where $a_k \rightarrow a_1$. Therefore,
    \[
        \limsup _ {\lambda \rightarrow \infty}
        U_{aa}(\tilde V(y | \lambda), a_1) > 0\text{.}
    \]
    This contradicts Lemma \ref{lem:inf_lambda_second_deriv}.
    
    For any $\lambda \geq \lambda_0$, we thus have that $U(\tilde V (y | \lambda), a)$ is concave in $a$. The proposition is proven by letting $U^*$ be the solution to $\lambda^*(U^*) = \lambda_0$. The agent's problem is concave in $a$ for $\bar{U} \in [U^*, U_{R}]$ because $\lambda^*(\bar{U})$ is monotonic by Proposition \ref{prop:relaxed-optimal-contract}.4 
\end{proof}

\noindent We conclude the section by proving two minor lemmas that we used in the above proofs. 

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:y_0} 
    There exists $y_0$ such that for all $y < y_0$, 
     $$ \Delta g(y | \lambda) \left( S^2(y|a) + S_a(y|a) \right) \cdot S(Y|a_0) \leq 0 .$$
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof} 
    The lemma follows from these 3 facts. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Delta g(y | \lambda) \geq 0$ 
        \item There exists $y_0$ such that  $S(Y|a_0) < 0$ for $y<y_0$
        \item There exists $y_0$ such that  $\left( S^2(y|a) + S_a(y|a) \right) > 0$ for $y \leq y_0$. 
    \end{enumerate} 
    The monotonicity of $g$ implies the first fact. The second fact follows from Assumption \ref{assump:regularity_S}.3. Assumption \ref{assump:regularity_S}.4 and the following algebra implies the final fact. 
    $$  S^2(y | \hat a) + S_a(y|a)
        = S^2(y | \hat a) + \frac{d}{da}\frac{f_a(y|a)}{f(y|a)}
        = S^2(y | \hat a) + \frac{f_{aa}(y|a)}{f(y|a)} - \frac{f_a(y|a)^2}{f(y|a)^2}
        = \frac{f_{aa}(y|a)\text{.}}{f(y|a)}. $$  
    The density is always positive, so the final expression is positive whenever $f_{aa}(y|a)$ is positive. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:mu_lambda} 
    As $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, $\frac{\tilde{\mu}}{\lambda} \rightarrow 0$. 
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof}
    Lemma \ref{lem:threshold-outcome} and assumption \ref{assump:regularity_S}.3 imply that $\ubar S (\lambda) \rightarrow -\infty$. The result follows from the definition of $\ubar S (\lambda)$.  
\end{proof}
